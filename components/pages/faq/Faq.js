        <p className="question">What is Nearnaut?</p>
        <p className="answer">
          Nearnaut is an NFT marketplace that allows you to mint your creations on the NEAR blockchain. You don’t even
          need NEAR tokens in your wallet to get started––Nearnaut will front the cost of your first three mints!

        <p className="question">What does “minting” mean?</p>
        <p className="answer">“Minting” means creating and publishing an NFT on a blockchain.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="faq">
        <p className="question">
          How can you offer minting with “no upfront costs” to people without funds in their NEAR wallet?
        </p>
        <p className="answer">
          Nearnaut uses a unique NEAR feature that allows us to supply a small amount of NEAR to an account so the user
          can get started. In exchange, the feature will deduct the cost of those mints from the first NFT sale (don’t
          worry: the cost of minting three pieces is less than 0.1 NEAR).
        </p>
        <p className="answer">
          Nearnaut also takes a 5% cut of all sales so that we can continue to enable other artists to mint without any
          upfront costs.

      <div className="faq">
        <p className="question">Can I fund my NEAR wallet through other methods?</p>
        <p className="answer">
          Definitely! If you already have some NEAR, you can start minting right away. If you add funds after you’ve
          started minting, you unlock the ability for unlimited mints.

      <div className="faq">
        <p className="question">Is minting my NFT on Nearnaut bad for the planet?</p>
        <p className="answer">
          Because Nearnaut is built on NEAR, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, the cost of minting 1 NFT is roughly
          equivalent to running your laptop for 2 minutes. In addition to the native efficiency of the network, NEAR has
          been certified as carbon-neutral. You can read more about NEAR’s carbon neutrality{' '}

          Pluminite operates on a “one strike, you’re out” rule. Because our platform allows anyone to mint 3 NFTs
          without any upfront cost, we cannot enable a more complex moderation system at this time. So if you violate
          our content rules, we will take down your entire profile, end of story.
